# hello-world
My first repository on this platform. Learn how to use it.  

I'm keen to participate in sharing work to create open sources better than anything else,because they will serve need for many people. That's the future. 
I'm working in the oil&gas drilling industry where a lot remains to be done before we're up to date with new techs. So, let's find common needs and share the work to adress them!
